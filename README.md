- ⚡ Fun fact:  I believe life is like a decision tree in programming: the root node is our birth, and every choice we make spawns a new branch of alternate realities. Just like in engineering, where every innovation spawns a new version update, I aim to debug life’s code and deploy realities that are as impactful as they are meaningful!
